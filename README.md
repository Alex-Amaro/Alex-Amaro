# **Yo, I'm Alex!** 🚀🤖

I'm a Computer Engineering student (Class of '28) at UC Irvine obsessed with the intersection of software, hardware, autonomy, and human impact. My ultimate goal's to create tech that'll enable us starside, while empowering our lives earthside. I'm vectored toward the space industry, but anything that genuinely serves people gets me excited! 

During my last internship in Japan, I built visualizations for computational fluid dynamics models at [Cardio Flow Design](https://cfd.life/en/) to help researchers tackle congenital heart diseases.

## Technical Skills
- **Programming:** C/C++, C#, Python, STM32 HAL Drivers, Unity Engine
- **Hardware/Embedded:** PCB Design & Debugging, MCUs (STM32), ADC, SPI/I²C/UART, Actuators / Sensors (e.g., IMUs, Motors)
- **Robotics & Control**: Finite State Machines, Feedback Systems, Sensor Fusion

If it's mission-critical, I'll see it through.

## What I _was_ up to
This fall, I designed a mixed-signal ADC PCB for the [UCI Rocket Project's](https://www.rocket.eng.uci.edu/liquids/) DAQ 
system. Once assembled and integrated this winter, it'll enable high-precision load cell measurement for **methalox rocket-engine thrust** and **recovery-parachute drag**.

You can follow the project [here](https://github.com/UCI-Rocket-Project/rocket2-loadcell2.0-hardware). 

The board's inspired by a legacy design, and features:
- Improved Hardware-level Noise Filtering
- Interfaces for Easier Accessibility (e.g., USB & Ethernet)
- Reduced e-footprint (~10% lower cost)
- "Cool aesthetic" (or so I've been told, would love to hear your thoughts!)

## What I'm _currently_ up to
Beyond spending time with familia and friends, I'm spending my winter break working on a self-balancing robot to level up my skills in:
- Firmware
- Electrical Circuits
- Signals & Systems
- Digital Signal Processing ⚡
- Control Systems (and sensor fusion, my beloved)

There's a nonzero chance this'll become a _battlebot_—I'm craving a return to the arena 😈

Stay tuned ;]
