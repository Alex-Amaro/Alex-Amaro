# **Yo, I'm Alex!** 🚀🤖

I'm a Computer Engineering student at UC Irvine obsessed with the intersection of software, hardware, autonomy, and human
impact. My ultimate goal's to create tech that'll enable us starside, while empowering our lives earthside. I'm vectored
toward the space industry, but anything that serves people gets me excited! ([See my last internship](https://cfd.life/en/)).

## Technical Skills
- **Programming:** C/C++, Python, C#
- **Hardware/Embedded:** PCB Design, Microcontrollers, SPI/I²C/UART, Sensor Integration
- **Robotics & Control**: FSMs, Motion Planning, Feedback Systems, Sensor Fusion

## What I'm up to right now
Currently, I'm designing and integrating sensors for a DAQ system to quantify the thrust strength 
of a methalox rocket engine for the [UCI Rocket Project](https://www.rocket.eng.uci.edu/liquids/)
