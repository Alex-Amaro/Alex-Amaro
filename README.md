# **Yo, I'm Alex!** 🚀🤖

I'm a Computer Engineering student at UC Irvine obsessed with the intersection of software, hardware, autonomy, and human
impact. My ultimate goal's to create tech that'll enable us starside, while empowering our lives earthside. I'm vectored
toward the space industry, but anything that serves people gets me excited! My last internship, I tackled congenital heart diseases with computational fluid dynamics at [Cardio Flow Design](https://cfd.life/en/).

## Technical Skills
- **Programming:** C/C++, C#, Python, Unity Engine
- **Hardware/Embedded:** PCB Design, Microcontrollers, ADC, SPI/I²C/UART, Sensor Integration
- **Robotics & Control**: Finite State Machines, Feedback Systems, Sensor Fusion,  Motion Planning

If it's mission-critical, I'll make it happen.

## What I'm up to right now
Currently, I'm integrating a mixed-signal ADC PCB I designed this fall for the [UCI Rocket Project's](https://www.rocket.eng.uci.edu/liquids/) DAQ 
system, enabling load-cell-based measurement of methalox rocket engine thrust and recovery-parachute drag. Check out my progress [here](https://github.com/UCI-Rocket-Project/rocket2-loadcell2.0-hardware).

## Reach out to me!
