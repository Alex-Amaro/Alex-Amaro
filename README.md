# **Yo, I'm Alex!** 🚀🤖

I'm a Computer Engineering student (Class of '28) at UC Irvine obsessed with the intersection of software, hardware, autonomy, and human impact. My ultimate goal's to create tech that'll enable us starside, while empowering our lives earthside. I'm vectored toward the space industry, but anything that serves people gets me excited! During my last internship in Japan, I helped tackle congenital heart diseases by building computational fluid dynamics models at [Cardio Flow Design](https://cfd.life/en/).

## Technical Skills
- **Programming:** C/C++, C#, Python, STM32 HAL Drivers, Unity Engine
- **Hardware/Embedded:** PCB Design & Debugging, MCUs (STM32), ADC, SPI/I²C/UART, Actuators / Sensors (e.g., IMUs, Motors)
- **Robotics & Control**: Finite State Machines, Sensor Fusion, Motion Planning

If it's mission-critical, I'll make it happen.

Stay tuned ;]

## What I _was_ up to
This fall quarter I designed a mixed-signal ADC PCB for the [UCI Rocket Project's](https://www.rocket.eng.uci.edu/liquids/) DAQ 
system. Upon PCBA and integration this winter, it'll enable enhanced load cell measurement of methalox-rocket-engine thrust and recovery-parachute drag.
Can't wait to see our propulsion and launch vehicle engineers nerd out over all the data. Check out my progress [here](https://github.com/UCI-Rocket-Project/rocket2-loadcell2.0-hardware). 

The board's inspired by a legacy design, it's got:
- Improved Hardware-level Noise Filtering
- Interfaces for Easier Accessibility (e.g., USB & Ethernet)
- Reduced e-footprint (~lowered cost 10%)
- "Cool aesthetic" (haha so I've been told, would love to hear your thoughts!)

## What I'm _currently_ up to
Beyond spending time with familia and friends, I'm spending my winter break working on a self-balancing robot to level up my skills in:
- Firmware
- Electrical Circuits
- Signals & Systems
- DSP
- Control Systems (and sensor fusion, my beloved~)

Might turn this into another _battlebot_—my cutest gremlins go straight to the battlefield! 😈
